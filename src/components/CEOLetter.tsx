                The alternatives are janky AIs that just frustrate customers. Or

                  hndl is building the first founder-only customer support
                  system for B2B Marketplaces.
                </strong>{" "}
                Software that takes care of your customers so well that you can
                scale customer support without ever hiring anyone else
              </p>

              <p>
                If you already have a customer support team. You'll never need
                to hire anyone beyond your current team
              </p>

              <p>
                If it's just you and your cofounders. You can scale to $1B
                without ever hiring anyone ever
              </p>

              <p>
                The way hndl works is simple, easy and familiar. You give
                instructions to an AI just like any other customer support AI
                tool
              </p>

              <p>
                The only thing that's different is our router which works in the
                background
              </p>

              <p>
                This router breaks your instructions down into microtasks. Then
                decides whether to assign each microtask to an AI or to a human
              </p>

              <p>
                AI does a better job of most of the microtasks so the router
                assigns most of them to AI. But sometimes it's best to get a
                human involved and the router assigns the microtask to a human
                from our pool of "handlers"
