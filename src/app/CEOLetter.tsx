                Our API lets your AI agent programmatically get a human to do
                any small one-off task which the AI needs help with
              </p>

              <p>
                The way hndl works is similar to data labeling services like
                Scale AI. But our humans are not training your AI. They&apos;re
                helping your AI agent do it&apos;s job
              </p>

              <p>
                We built a pool of vetted humans in low cost geographies who are
                specialized in doing one-off tasks delegated by an AI. And your
                AI agent can easily put these humans to work through a simple
                API call
              </p>

              <p>
                There&apos;s 0 management work for you just an API. You&apos;re
                in full control of which humans are working on which of your
                tasks. And from the perspective of your users, they can&apos;t
                tell that there&apos;s a human in the loop at all
              </p>

              <p>
                Plus the work is always reliable because we give your AI tools
                to QA the work our humans did
              </p>
