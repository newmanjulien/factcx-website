                You&apos;re the CEO of a venture-backed startup. Which means
                you&apos;re one of the busiest people in the world
              </p>

              <p>
                You have co-founders who you trust and rely on. You have a
                top-notch team who supports you. And you might even have an EA
                or a Chief of Staff who makes your life so much easier
              </p>

              <p>

                Imagine if you could take 3 time-consuming tasks. Then make them
                easy and quick
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Email & Slack:</strong> You spend most of your day
                answering emails and/or Slack messages. Which means you&apos;re
                not doing everything else. Let us triage your emails and Slack
                so you spend less time on unimportant stuff and never miss
                important messages
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>After sales calls:</strong> Customers want to talk to
                you and you love talking to them. But it&apos;s hard to do all
                the work that comes after each sales call. Let us update your
                CRM, follow up, make sure action items get done, etc
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Customer success:</strong> Staying involved in your
                customer success and customer support motions lets you stay
                close to users. But it&apos;s hard to keep up with the
                repetitive parts. Let us help answer customer questions, prepare
                calls, gather data for check-ins with customers, etc.

                hndl is the first AI agent that actually can do those 3 tasks in
                a way that&apos;s good enough to be useful. Because hndl is the
                first AI agent that combines what AI does best with what humans
                do best
              </p>

              <p>
                Our AI does most of its work with tool calls. Like other AI
                agents
              </p>

              <p>
                The difference is that hndl is the first AI agent that can also
                make human calls. In other words, our AI calls on humans to do
                parts of the work
              </p>
