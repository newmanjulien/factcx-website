                Doing Customer Success well means knowing better than everyone
                else what's going on with your customers. But how can you do
                that when it's so hard for CSMs to get customer data?
              </p>

              <p>
                The data you need to prepare for your next QBR, understand the
                health of an account or make the case for an expansion is{" "}

              </p>

              <p>
                You need to query Posthog to get usage data. Check Pylon and
                Linear for open tickets. Look in Gainsight to understand the
                account history. Beg the dev team to help you get some more
                niche data you can't get otherwise. Then double check in other
                places because that data might actually be outdated
              </p>

              <p>
                FACT lets CSMs request any Customer Success data then easily get
                the accurate, up-to-date and complete data they need
              </p>

              <p>
                We use all your data from all your platforms and tools.
                Structured data from Posthog, Gainsight, etc. And also from call
                transcripts, Slack, emails, Notion, etc.
              </p>

              <p>
                Then we check external data to be sure everything is up-to date.
                For example, we'll check LinkedIn to see if your champion
                changed jobs
              </p>

              <p>
                And you always be the highest quality results because there's a
                human in the loop who double checks the data before you receive
                it
