                And the alternatives seem to be low quality outsourcing. Or AIs

              <p>It doesn&apos;t need to be like this</p>

                  hndl is the first founder-only customer support system.
                </strong>{" "}
                Our software takes care of your startup&apos;s customers so well
                that you can scale customer support without ever hiring anyone
                else
              </p>

              <p>
                The way hndl works is simple, easy and familiar. It&apos;s just
                kust like with any agentic AI
              </p>

              <p>
                What&apos;s different is that hndl&apos;s AI can get help from
                humans
              </p>

              <p>
                When you give instructions to our AI, it knows which parts it
                can do well. And which parts a human would be a lot better
              </p>

              <p>
                The AI has access to hndl's pool of human workers who are
                specialized in doing one-off tasks our AI delegates to them. And
                the AI gets those humans to take care of the tasks which humans
                do better than AI
              </p>

              <p>
                The result is an AI-lead system which does your customer support
                so well you'll never hire anyone else
              </p>
