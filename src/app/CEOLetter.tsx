                Your business has significantly less revenue than it should
                because you&apos;re not offering enterprise-grade Customer

              <p>
                Because your Customer Success Managers are getting bogged down
                by high volume, low level transactional conversations with
                customers. Instead of spending time on upselling and renewals
              </p>

              <p>
                And the result is that customer churn is higher than it should
                be. Your renewal rate is lower than it should. And you&apos;re
                not getting the upsell expansions you would with
                enterprise-grade Customer Success

                Most SaaS businesses struggle with this. The problem is that{" "}

              <p>
                hndl is building Customer Success automation that&apos;s so good
                you can offer enterprise-grade Customer Success to all your
                customers at any scale without ever hiring another Customer

              <p>
                hndl is easy, quick and intuitive to set up. You set up our AI
                agents using a familiar workflow UI which lets you program and
                customize the AI for your business
              </p>

              <p>
                What&apos;s different about hndl is that we have humans in the
                loop
              </p>

              <p>
                You give instructions to hndl&apos;s AI agents and the AI does
                your Customer Success work. The reason the AI does such great
                work is that when it encounters a task which humans would do
                better. It asks one of the Customer Success Experts at hndl HQ
                to help
